# Debug Authentication Issues

## Current Problem
You're getting "You are not authenticated" even after signing in.

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Look for these messages**:
   - "Checking stored auth state..."
   - "Google Identity Services initialized successfully"
   - "Token client initialized: true"

### Step 2: Test Authentication
1. **Click "Test Authentication"** button
2. **Check console output** - it will show:
   - Current authentication state
   - LocalStorage contents
   - Google Identity Services status

### Step 3: Try Sign In
1. **Click "ðŸ”‘ Sign In to Edit"**
2. **Complete Google authentication**
3. **Check console** for:
   - "Token response received:"
   - "Access token received successfully"

### Step 4: Check Auth Status
1. **Click "Check Auth Status"**
2. **Look at console** for detailed status

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Token client not initialized"
**Solution**: Google Identity Services didn't load properly
- Refresh the page
- Check if you're using `http://localhost:8000`

### Issue 2: "No stored authentication state found"
**Solution**: Authentication didn't complete or wasn't stored
- Try signing in again
- Check for popup blockers

### Issue 3: "The given origin is not allowed"
**Solution**: OAuth2 client configuration issue
- Use `http://localhost:8000` (not 127.0.0.1:5500)
- Or update OAuth2 client origins

### Issue 4: Popup blocked
**Solution**: Use alternative authentication
- Click "Alternative Sign In" button
- Complete authentication in same window

## Expected Console Output (Success)
```
Checking stored auth state...
Google Identity Services initialized successfully
Token client initialized: true
Token response received: {access_token: "...", ...}
Access token received successfully
Auth Status: {isSignedIn: true, userEmail: "...", accessToken: "Present"}
```

## Next Steps
1. **Run the debug steps above**
2. **Share the console output** if issues persist
3. **Try the alternative sign-in method** if popup is blocked
